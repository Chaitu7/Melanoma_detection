# Project Name
Melanoma detection using CNN based model


## Table of Contents
* Notebook having analysis code


## General Information
Build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


## Conclusions
- Balancing the dataset imporved the model accuracy
- Solved the model overfitting problem
- As number of epochs increases, computation time increases
- Error is also reduced 



## Technologies Used
- python - version 3.11.9
